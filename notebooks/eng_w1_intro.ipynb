    "## Programming Languages: History and Popular Technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Programming language: a set of commands and rules used to create a computer program\n",
    "- Computer program: a sequence of instructions prepared in a programming language, translated into machine language\n",
    "- Simplification: a computer program is an algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of programming languages:\n",
    "- Compiler: running a program after a change in the code requires translating the code into instructions understandable to the device (e.g. C++, Java)\n",
    "- Scripting: the code uses ready-made functions that are already compiled (e.g. Python, PHP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Generations of programming languages:\n",
    "- 5GL: languages ​​that solve problems with no or minimal involvement of the programmer, e.g. Prolog (a logical programming language)\n",
    "- 4GL: code that calls code written in 3GL, e.g. SQL, LabVIEW; graphical programming environments\n",
    "- 3GL: more device agnostic, examples include C, C++, Java; in this group also more advanced languages ​​than 3GL, often using 3GL but not meeting the criteria of 4GL, e.g. Python\n",
    "- 2GL: code in which one instruction corresponds to one instruction of machine code\n",
    "- 1GL: machine code, specific to a given device\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage of programming languages – sample division:\n",
    "- Devices\n",
    "- Operating systems\n",
    "- Applications\n",
    "- Websites\n",

    "- Frontend\n",
    "- Backend\n",
    "- Fullstack\n",
    "- Mobile\n",
    "- Embedded\n",
    "- Data science\n",
    "- Other\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of programming languages:\n",
    "- Structural: programming paradigm based on dividing the program's source code into procedures and hierarchically arranged blocks using control structures in the form of selection and loop instructions\n",
    "- Object-oriented: programming paradigm in which programs are defined using objects – elements combining state and behavior\n",
    "- Declarative: based on the assumption that the programmer defines the goal, not the way to achieve it\n",
    "- Functional: emphasis is on evaluating functions, not executing commands\n",
