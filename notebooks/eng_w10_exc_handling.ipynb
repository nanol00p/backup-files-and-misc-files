    "## Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "A good program should be error-resistant and end successfully – it should handle errors in such a way that it does not affect the user experience (UX).\n",
    "\n",
    "The planning and the entire strategy for handling exceptions is not only the responsibility of programmers, but also of business owners and may result from the company's goals or applicable law.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing the application at different stages of the application life cycle by different people allows you to identify errors that the programmer did not notice\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper exception handling is difficult and time-consuming:\n",
    "- It complicates the code significantly\n",
    "- In many cases, error handling can be longer than the positive path\n",
    "- Most often, more test cases concern exception handling than the positive path\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exception**:\n",
    "- Error in program operation\n",
    "- Failure to handle a specific type of event\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "- A given character instead of a number\n",
    "- Error establishing a connection\n",
    "- Error reading a file\n",
    "- Non-existent variable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical exception**:\n",
    "A term used in reference to an exception that cannot be handled, e.g. an operating system failure\n",
    "\n",
    "ISQBT definitions:\n",
    "- **Mistake**: human error in the software code resulting from time pressure, lack of experience, knowledge\n",
    "- **Defect**: consequence of an error, incorrect operation of the application\n",
    "- **Failure**: effect of a defect, most often affecting the application or its module\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: syllabus from https://sjsi.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the error is a **traceback**, also known as stack trace, stack traceback, backtrace. This is the exact information about where the exception occurred.\n",
