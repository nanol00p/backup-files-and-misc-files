    "Problems of modern software:\n",
    "- Time and pressure to deliver software (Time to Market: TTM, Time to Value: TTV)\n",
    "- Variability of requirements over time\n",
    "- Software complexity\n",
    "- Various IT technologies, along with their imperfections\n",
    "- Various levels of IT staff competence\n",
    "- Incorrect technological choices and shallow knowledge of selected technologies\n",
    "- The presence of IT in virtually every area of ​​life\n",
    "\n",
    "People's lives often depend on the quality of software. Examples:\n",
    "- Therac-25: a radiology machine. As a result of incorrect implementation (race), at least several people were irradiated and five died.\n",
    "- Iraq: a Patriot missile miscalculated the trajectory of an Iraqi missile and aborted the attempt to shoot it down. 28 American soldiers were killed and 98 were injured.\n",
    "- Unintentional acceleration or loss of driver control over engine power in Toyota cars due to code errors is the probable cause of at least 89 deaths and injuries to at least 57 more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Famous Boeing 737 MAX-8 and MAX-9 crashes: \"The cause of these tragic events was software known as MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System), which was supposed to make the aircraft easier to operate. However, MCAS, controlled by only one Angle of Attack (AoA) sensor, constantly turned on as if the sensor was malfunctioning, repeatedly pushing the plane's nose down and ultimately making it impossible to control the aircraft.\" Source: ulc.gov.pl\n",
    "- Tesla autonomous car accidents caused by misinterpretation of reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize:\n",
    "- Software delivery is a complex process\n",
    "- A structured approach is needed to deliver increasingly complex software\n",
    "- The need to provide tools for software quality control\n",
    "- The scientific method is used in both project management and software engineering to improve software quality, estimate time consumption or test software"

    "**Linear Model**\n",
    "- Also called the waterfall or waterfall model\n",
    "- A model that assumes that each phase of the software lifecycle happens only once, and the project is implemented from start to finish according to a specific process\n",
    "- This is a good model for implementing a project with well-specified and stable requirements over time, i.e., for small and short projects\n",
    "- The model is criticized for being rigid with respect to requirements and limiting interaction with the client\n",

    "Basic information:\n",
    "- The name comes from the Unified Modeling Language\n",
    "- It includes several diagrams that serve to comprehensively present the architecture and operation of an IT system\n",
    "- Diagrams can be divided into 3 groups:\n",
    "- Structural (component, class and implementation diagram)\n",
    "- Behavioral (activity, state and use case diagram)\n",
    "- Interaction (sequence and time diagrams)\n",
    "\n",
    "Component diagram:\n",
    "- The diagram shows the dependencies between the components of an information system\n",
    "- In many cases, dependencies are invoked remote operations (interfaces) made available via APIs (English Application Programming Interface)\n",
    "- The diagram allows you to identify the components involved in a given communication and detect dependent changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Class diagram:\n",
    "- A method of designing changes used in object-oriented programming\n",
    "- Classes are defined (their name, attributes and methods) and dependencies between classes (association, inheritance)\n",
    "- In the case of attributes and methods, their type, requirement, visibility are defined\n",
    "- Modern CASE tools allow you to convert UML diagrams to working code in a selected programming language\n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment diagram:\n",
    "- It presents the infrastructure project related to the analyzed business process\n",
    "- It contains such infrastructure elements as:\n",
    "  - Name of the server room or cloud computing region\n",
    "  - Name of the machine (with the type and name of the operating system) or the service used\n",
    "  - Name of the implemented or planned to be implemented application\n",
    "  - Dependencies between virtual machines\n",
    "  - Dependencies between applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Activity diagram:\n",
    "- It describes activities related to the implementation of computational and business processes\n",
    "- In a sense, it is similar to BPMN, while the UML activity diagram is object-oriented, unlike BPMN, which describes a process\n",
    "\n",
    "State diagram:\n",
    "- A diagram describing the transitions between application states\n",
    "- The diagram is used, for example, in the design of BPM systems (English Business Process Management) or order fulfillment systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Use case diagram:\n",
    "- Diagram defining actors (participants in a given process) and activities\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence diagram:\n",
    "- Diagram showing the flow of calls between multiple actors (IT systems and users)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contains events such as sending a synchronous (request and response) and asynchronous query (publishing an event, sending an email)\n",
    "- May contain loops, parallel processing and optional activities\n",
    "\n",
    "Time diagram:\n",
    "- Diagram defining events and activities of individual systems on a timeline\n",
    "- May be useful, for example, when designing an architecture based on microservices\n",
    "\n",
    "UML criticism:\n",
    "- Too technical and object-oriented (\"package import is a relationship between an importing namespace and a package, indicating that the importing namespace adds the names of the members of the package to its own namespace.\")\n",
    "- It is not a programming language but a drawing system that simultaneously requires precise definitions\n",
    "- No diagram for modeling databases\n",
    "- No representation of requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Best UML diagram usage practices:\n",
    "- UML is perfect for system analysis and design of IT systems\n",
    "- Most UML diagrams are understandable and can be very useful, e.g. implementation diagrams can be used for discussions with infrastructure management teams\n",
    "- However, it is not necessary to use all of them, and in fact it should be limited to those that are important for the project\n",
    "- Low-level design in UML can lead to discrepancies between the documentation and the working software over time - it is worth maintaining an appropriately high level of detail\n",
    "- Some diagrams (e.g. class diagrams) can be single-use - after the project is completed, they can serve as design documentation\n",
    "- Other notations can be used during design"
