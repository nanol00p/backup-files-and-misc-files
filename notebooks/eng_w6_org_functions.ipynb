    "# Lecture 6: Code organization and functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people start working on a computer program in one file, without separating code fragments as functions. Initially, this has a number of advantages:\n",
    "- the code is simple and the overhead for additional structures is minimal\n",
    "- the code is in one file\n",
    "- you can easily search for selected strings and operations\n",
    "- you don't have to import other files\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, such code becomes difficult to maintain and develop:\n",
    "- scrolling to the so-called other end of the file takes a lot of time\n",
    "- it's easy to miss important code fragments\n",
    "- we lose the so-called big picture, i.e. the general understanding of how the code works\n",
    "- duplicate code fragments appear\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these problems, the code is divided into external files, where functions, classes, error handling, configuration and many other important components of the created computer program are transferred. Creating increasingly complex structures is a natural consequence of code development and in some cases the code must be rebuilt before starting to add new functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's lecture, we will discuss functions and loading functions from external files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions - use:\n",
    "- Improved application readability: code becomes modular\n",
    "- Multiple use of the same code fragments: avoiding redundancy\n",
    "- Possibility to move functions to external files and modules\n",
    "- Possibility to call themselves (recursion)\n",
    "- Sharing with other programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions - declaring:\n",
    "- The def keyword\n",
    "- The snake_case naming convention\n",
    "- Optional:\n",
    "  - Input parameters\n",
    "  - Output parameters - returned in the return command\n",
    "- Place of declaration:\n",
    "  - to simplify: any, but before calling the function\n",
    "  - most often we declare them at the beginning of the file or in separate files\n",
    "  - a function can also be defined inside the code, even immediately before its use."
