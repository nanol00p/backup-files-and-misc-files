    "Selected concepts:\n",
    "- LAN (local area network): a local network connecting computers in a certain area\n",
    "- VPN (virtual private network): a tunnel connecting computers into a private network via a public network\n",
    "- WAN (wide area network): a network extending beyond a city or country; the largest existing one is the Internet\n",
    "- DNS (Domain Name System): a system that translates a domain name into an IP address\n",
    "- IP address: a numerical identifier given to a network interface\n",
    "- Host: any machine participating in the exchange of data\n",
    "- Localhost, 127.0.0.1: the host name and IPv4 address of the local computer. Communication with the address 127.0.0.1 means the exchange of information within a given host.\n",
    "- Port: a way of identifying a running process or service; many services have a strictly defined port resulting from the use of a given technology or communication protocol\n",
    "- Communication protocol: a specific way of communicating between two or more entities participating in communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up:\n",
    "- The computer (host) sees itself as localhost and communicates within itself using this address\n",
    "- Within local networks, it uses a local address\n",
    "- On the Internet, it uses a public address (IP)\n",
    "- Addresses are most often assigned dynamically\n",
    "- Users and applications also use domain addresses\n",
    "- Domain addresses are used in both public and local networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Selected communication protocols:\n",
    "- File transfer: FTP: 21\n",
    "- Connecting to the server: SSH: 22\n",
    "- Internet: HTTP: 80, 8080, HTTPS: 443\n",
    "- Mail (POP3: 110, SMTP: 25, IMAP: 143)\n",
    "- Databases (Oracle: 1521, SQL Server: 1433, Postgres: 5432, MongoDB: 27017)\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP protocol - protocol for sending and receiving documents hypertext on the web. HTTP methods:\n",
    "- GET: request access to a resource\n",
    "- PUT: request update of a resource\n",
    "- POST: request creation of a resource or sending of data\n",
    "- DELETE: request removal of a resource\n",
    "- PATCH: request update of part of a resource\n",
    "- Headers: metadata containing e.g. document format or authorization data\n",
