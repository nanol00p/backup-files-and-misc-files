    "In the previous lecture and the corresponding exercises, we learned about the very basic capabilities of the Python language. These include:\n",
    "- basic data types\n",
    "- defining a variable\n",
    "- displaying a variable and its type\n",
    "- commenting\n",
    "- using logical operators\n",
    "- the if-else conditional statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's capabilities can be significantly expanded by using additional libraries. Some of them, e.g. the so-called standard library, are installed with the interpreter, others, e.g. the popular Pandas, require separate installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A library is a set of functions related to a specific issue, e.g. files of a specific format, databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth adding that popular libraries are constantly modified by programmers. Their code is available, e.g. on GitHub and practically anyone can download it, change it and report a change. People responsible for the development of a given library will review the proposed change and may accept it, thanks to which the change will be promoted to a new version of the library. Sometimes a library is no longer developed and it may turn out that in certain cases it stops working.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth remembering that changes are not necessarily backward compatible. **Backward compatibility** means that after updating the library, the code will work. In practice, popular libraries are modified by the so-called community, and updating to a new version can affect the working code. For this reason, after updating the library, **regression testing** is recommended, i.e. checking whether the library still works.\n"

    "You can also specify the version of the library to be installed, such as **pip install pandas==0.25.3** You can also specify the maximum or minimum version of the library to install. Although the most common operation is to install or update to a version newer than the installed or latest one, known as an upgrade, sometimes you downgrade the version, e.g. due to changes in functions - this is then a downgrade.\n",
