    "\n",
    "Structured programming is a programming paradigm that assumes the division of code into procedures and blocks, executed sequentially or in a loop. Until the introduction of object-oriented programming, it was the main programming paradigm and it is still widely used, for example in data science (where data is not projected onto objects, but processed in a more sequential way).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic components (control structures) of object-oriented programming are:\n",
    "- sequence - a series of subsequent instructions\n",
    "- selection - execution of one of the groups of instructions depending on the condition\n",
    "- loop - multiple execution of the same code sequence for subsequent iterated values\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured programming is the right choice if we can define the next steps of the program, for example:\n",
    "- business process\n",
    "- processing large data in a specific way\n",
    "- or simply an ordinary computer program that has a beginning, business logic and an end\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured programming is supplemented by, for example, block diagrams and UML activity diagrams, which are intended to visualize the operation of the program. An example diagram is presented below."

However, when writing software, many programmers forget that the basic step should be to determine how it should work before it is created. The costs of fixing a mistake, in this case the lack of design, will increase with time. Transferring the program's operation to a diagram will allow both the programmer to channel their thinking and other people will be able to understand the program's operation and provide appropriate comments.\n",
